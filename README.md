# DL_Lab_SS20
This's my draft Implementation of Assignments and Project of Deep Learning Lab course at University of Freiburg. It's not finalised and it'll be updated by more comments explaining everything soon.

Assignment 1 projects:
1- Self-Supervised Learning for Binary semantic segmentation with COCO dataset 

2-Attention Based Semantic Segmentation for COCO dataset

Assignment 3 projects:
1- Behavioral cloning agent using Imitation learning for modified version of OpenAI Car Racing gym environment

2- Reinforcement Learning algorithm (DQN) to control a modified version of OpenAI continuous Cart Pole gym environment (achieving a reward of 400+ in max of 500 steps after training for only 150k steps) and Car Racing gym environment (achieving average test rewards 850+ )

Note: Assignment 2 was about Neural Architecture Search (NAS) new library and It's not published yet so, I"ll not upload it to the public now.

The Project will be uploaded once we as a team of three (Chengxin, Thomas and me) submit it.
