# DL_Lab_SS20
This's my draft Implementation of Assignments and Project of Deep Learning Lab course at University of Freiburg. It's not finalised and it'll be updated by more comments explaining everything soon.
Note: Assignment two was about Neural Architecture Search (NAS) new library and It's not published yet so, I"ll not upload it to the public now.
